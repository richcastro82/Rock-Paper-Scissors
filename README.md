# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the classic rock paper scissors game we all know and love. I created this graphical version of my terminal rock-paper-scissors game. I used free stock images from Canva.com and made the whole game over the weekend. I really love how this one came out.


I used free sound resources from FreeSound.org  \

This game is part of my programming portfolio. It's an example of python programming and has a few programming concepts. Object Oriented Programming, Vector arrays, game logic and graphics. I have a list of upgrades planned for this game in the near future. Poison apples, obsticles, a pause screen, high score board, and a few others.
